	    <p>Here's how you use this:</p>
            <p>
              First, work out who gets deductions, and write it down somewhere. Write the total amount of plat to be split into the "Platinum" field, in plat. For example, if you have 1432pp 50g, you write "1432.5" (that's a dot, not a comma). In the big text area, you'll write the names of whoever gets deductions, one per line, as the example shows. The deductions must be written in plat amounts preceded by a minus sign, and you can put multiple deductions per line. As soon as you click outside one of the fields, the results on the right will be updated.
            </p>
            <p>
              You'll get back a list of the players you entered for deductions, the amount of plat each of these gets, and the amount of plat each of the other members get. You'll also get a calculation detail, in case you don't trust me, or want to keep it for log purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Talking about logs... If you have a modern browser that supports Web Storage, each calculation log, the users, and their most recent deductions are saved locally in your browser, and will pop back when you open the page again. As the name suggests, it all happens locally in your browser. You can safely use this page offline, if you wish.
